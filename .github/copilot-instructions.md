# Linku

Linku is a messaging app. The codebase is a monorepo with two main packages: `web` and `api`, for frontend and backend respectively.

Check the requirements of the project [here](../docs/linku.md).

## General Guidelines

- Use kebab-case for file names.
- Use `pnpm test` in the project you are to run tests.
